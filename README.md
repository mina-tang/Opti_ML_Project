# Opti_ML_Project
## Environement Setup
To setup, please first install the packages in `requirement.txt`. For Pytorch, as the specific version depends on CUDA, install your prefered version from [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/), using the stable release (2.3.0). 

## Benchmarks
The benchmarks consist of the following problems:
- P0: 
- P1: simple CNN (2c2d) for classification on the Fashion MNIST dataset, evaluated on accuracy
- P3: VAE, same as P2 but with Fashion MNIST
- P4: All-CNN-C for classification on CIFAR-100, evaluated on accuracy
- P5: next word prediction using a 2-layer bidirectional LSTM trained on wikitext-2 and evaluated on accuracy
